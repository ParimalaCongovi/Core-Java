/*You are given n pairs of strings. Two pairs (a,b)  and (c,d) are identical if a=c and b=d. That also implies (a,b) is not same as (b,a).
After taking each pair as input, you need to print number of unique pairs you currently have.

Complete the code in the editor to solve this problem.

Input Format

In the first line, there will be an integer T denoting number of pairs. 
Each of the next T lines will contain two strings seperated by a single space.

Output Format

Print T lines. In the i line, print number of unique pairs you have after taking i pair as input.

Sample Input
5
john tom
john mary
john tom
mary anna
mary anna

Sample Output
1
2
2
3
3

Explanation

After taking the first input, you have only one pair: (john,tom)
After taking the second input, you have two pairs: (john, tom) and (john, mary)
After taking the third input, you still have two unique pairs.
After taking the fourth input, you have three unique pairs: (john,tom), (john, mary) and (mary, anna)
After taking the fifth input, you still have three unique pairs.*/
